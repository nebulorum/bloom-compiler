# Bloom Compiler Fork

This is a fork of @JoshRosen's [Bloom compiler](https://github.com/JoshRosen/bloom-compiler).  The main purpose of this fork is to provide Bloom-to-Dedalus
and Bloom-to-c4lang translations, and to extend the bloom-like language with a module system to support
'include' and 'import' statements in the style of Bud.  Support for nested records is in progress.
